    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        Establishes an authenticated connection to VMware Cloud Foundation SDDC Manager.

        .DESCRIPTION
        The Connect-SddcManager function provides comprehensive connection management for SDDC Manager,
        supporting both interactive and non-interactive authentication modes. It offers:

        - JSON credential file support for automated/headless operations
        - Interactive credential prompting when JSON files are unavailable
        - Automatic credential file creation for future non-interactive use
        - Token-based authentication with session management
        - Comprehensive error handling for various connection failure scenarios
        - Reconnection capability using cached credentials

        The function handles the complete authentication workflow:
        1. Credential acquisition (JSON file or interactive prompts)
        2. Connection attempt with detailed error handling
        3. Optional credential file creation for future use
        4. Session validation and token management

        Administrative privileges are required on the SDDC Manager for successful authentication.

        .PARAMETER SddcManagerCredentialsJson
        Path to the JSON file containing SDDC Manager credentials. The file should contain:
        - sddcManagerFqdn: Fully qualified domain name of the SDDC Manager
        - sddcManagerUserName: SSO or federated username
        - sddcManagerPassword: User password

        If the file doesn't exist, the function will prompt for credentials interactively
        and optionally create the file for future use. Default: "SddcManagerCredentials.Json"

        Note: This parameter is a file path (String), not the credential itself. The actual
        credentials are stored securely in the file and handled as PSCredential/SecureString
        during processing.

        .PARAMETER Reconnect
        Forces reconnection using previously cached credentials (stored in script-scoped variables).
        This is useful when tokens have expired or connections have been lost. Bypasses credential
        prompting and file operations when cached credentials are available.

        .EXAMPLE
        Connect-SddcManager

        Connects using default credential file or prompts for credentials if file doesn't exist.
        Offers to save credentials to JSON file after successful connection.

        .EXAMPLE
        Connect-SddcManager -SddcManagerCredentialsJson "ProductionCredentials.json"

        Connects using credentials from a custom JSON file path.

        .EXAMPLE
        Connect-SddcManager -Reconnect

        Reconnects using cached credentials from a previous session, useful for token refresh.

        .NOTES
        - Requires VCF.PowerCLI or VMware.PowerCLI module
        - Creates script-scoped variables for connection management

Function Disconnect-SddcManager {

    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        Safely disconnects from SDDC Manager with optional user confirmation and logging control.

        .DESCRIPTION
        The Disconnect-SddcManager function provides a controlled way to terminate SDDC Manager
        connections with various operation modes:

        - Interactive mode: Prompts user for confirmation before disconnecting
        - Automatic mode: Disconnects without prompts (useful for cleanup scenarios)
        - Silent mode: Suppresses console output while maintaining file logging
        - Custom prompts: Allows override of default confirmation messages

        The function is typically called in these scenarios:
        - Automatic cleanup when exiting interactive scripts
        - User-initiated disconnection in interactive mode
        - Switching between different SDDC Manager instances
        - Cleanup in automated/headless operations

        The function validates connection state before attempting disconnection and
        provides appropriate feedback based on the operation mode.

        .PARAMETER NoPrompt
        Bypasses user confirmation and disconnects immediately. Useful for:
        - Automated cleanup operations.
        - Error handling scenarios.
        - Script termination sequences.

        .PARAMETER OverrideQuestion
        Custom confirmation message to display instead of the default disconnect prompt.
        This allows context-specific prompts (e.g., "Switch to different SDDC Manager?").
        Only used when NoPrompt is not specified.

        .PARAMETER Silence
        Suppresses console output while maintaining file logging. The disconnect
        operation and results are still logged to file for audit purposes.

        .EXAMPLE
        Disconnect-SddcManager

        Standard interactive disconnect with default confirmation prompt.

        .EXAMPLE
        Disconnect-SddcManager -NoPrompt

        Immediate disconnect without user confirmation, typically used in cleanup.

        .EXAMPLE
        Disconnect-SddcManager -OverrideQuestion "Switch to different SDDC Manager?"

        Custom confirmation message for specific use cases.

        .EXAMPLE
        Disconnect-SddcManager -NoPrompt -Silence

        Silent disconnect for automated operations with file-only logging.

        .NOTES
        - Checks connection state before attempting disconnection.
        - Maintains connection information for logging after disconnection.
        - Supports both interactive and automated operation modes.
        - Always logs disconnection attempts and results to file.

Function Get-SddcManagerAccessTokenExpiry {

    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        Calculates and returns the time-to-live (TTL) in minutes for the current SDDC Manager access token.

        .DESCRIPTION
        The Get-SddcManagerAccessTokenExpiry function decodes and analyzes the current SDDC Manager
        access token to determine how much time remains before it expires. This information is
        crucial for:

        - Proactive token refresh before expiration.
        - Session management and connection health monitoring.
        - Avoiding authentication failures during long-running operations.
        - Determining when reconnection is necessary.

        The function performs JWT (JSON Web Token) decoding to extract the expiration claim,
        converts it to local time, and calculates the remaining time in minutes.

        The process includes:
        1. Extracting the access token from the active connection.
        2. Base64 decoding the JWT payload.
        3. JSON parsing to extract expiration timestamp.
        4. Time zone conversion and TTL calculation.

        .OUTPUTS
        System.Double
        Returns the time-to-live in minutes as a double-precision number.
        Returns $null if token decoding fails.
        Returns $false if no active token exists.

        .EXAMPLE
        $timeRemaining = Get-SddcManagerAccessTokenExpiry
        if ($timeRemaining -lt 30) {

Function Test-SddcManagerConnection {

    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        Verifies SDDC Manager connection health and automatically handles token refresh or reconnection.

        .DESCRIPTION
        The Test-SddcManagerConnection function provides comprehensive connection health monitoring
        and automatic remediation for SDDC Manager sessions. It performs:.

        - Token expiration checking with configurable minimum TTL.
        - Automatic token refresh when approaching expiration.
        - Connection validation through API calls.
        - Automatic reconnection when tokens are expired or invalid.
        - Graceful handling of various connection failure scenarios.

        The function uses a two-tier approach:
        1. First, check token TTL and refresh if below minimum threshold.
        2. If no token exists, validate connection through API call and reconnect if needed.

        This function should be called before any SDDC Manager API operations to ensure
        a valid, authenticated session is available.

        .EXAMPLE
        Test-SddcManagerConnection

        Verifies connection health and automatically handles any required reconnection.

        .EXAMPLE
        # Before performing SDDC Manager operations
        Test-SddcManagerConnection
        $domains = Invoke-VcfGetDomains

        Ensures valid connection before API calls.

        .NOTES
        - Uses 30-minute minimum TTL threshold by default.
        - Automatically calls Connect-SddcManager when reconnection is needed.
        - Handles both token-based and API-based connection validation.
        - Clears error variables to prevent false positives.
        - Should be called before any long-running operations.

Function Connect-Vcenter {

    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        Establishes a secure connection to vCenter or ESX host instances with unified connection management.

        .DESCRIPTION
        The Connect-Vcenter function creates a secure connection to either vCenter or ESX host
        using PSCredential objects for authentication. It provides unified connection management for both
        server types with intelligent duplicate connection detection and comprehensive error handling.

        The function includes advanced connection state management that checks for existing connections
        and provides detailed information about current sessions, including the connected username.
        It uses SecureString parameters to ensure password security and automatically handles
        connection state validation.

        Key features:
        - Unified connection management for both vCenter and ESX hosts
        - Secure credential handling using PSCredential objects
        - Intelligent duplicate connection detection with existing session details
        - Comprehensive error handling and structured logging
        - Graceful handling of existing connections with detailed user information
        - Connection state validation to prevent duplicate connections

        .PARAMETER ServerCredential
        A PSCredential object containing the username and password for authentication to the target server.
        This should contain a valid user account with appropriate permissions for the operations being performed.
        For vCenter: Supports both local vCenter accounts and SSO domain accounts (e.g., administrator@vsphere.local).
        For ESX: Typically uses root account or other local ESX user accounts.
        Using PSCredential objects ensures that passwords are handled securely and not exposed in plain text.

        .PARAMETER ServerName
        The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address of the server to connect to.
        This can be either a vCenter or an ESX host, depending on the ServerType parameter.
        This parameter is mandatory and must be a valid, reachable server instance.

        .PARAMETER ServerType
        Specifies the type of server being connected to. Valid values are "vCenter" or "ESX".
        This parameter determines the connection context and affects logging messages and error handling.
        - "vCenter": Connects to a vCenter instance for centralized management
        - "ESX": Connects directly to an ESX host for host-specific operations

        .EXAMPLE
        $credential = Get-Credential -message "Enter vCenter credentials"
        Connect-Vcenter -ServerName "vcenter.example.com" -ServerCredential $credential -ServerType "vCenter"

        Connects to a vCenter using credentials obtained from Get-Credential cmdlet.

        .EXAMPLE
        $securePassword = Read-Host "Enter ESX password" -asSecureString
        $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential("root", $securePassword)
        Connect-Vcenter -ServerName "ESX-host.example.com" -ServerCredential $credential -ServerType "ESX"

        Connects to an ESX host using a PSCredential object created from secure input.

        .EXAMPLE
        Connect-Vcenter -ServerName $Script:vCenterName -ServerCredential $vCenterCredential -ServerType "vCenter"
        Connect-Vcenter -ServerName $esxHost -ServerCredential $esxCredential -ServerType "ESX"

        Example of connecting to both vCenter and ESX host in sequence using variables.

        .NOTES
        - Requires VMware PowerCLI to be installed and imported before execution
        - The function gracefully handles existing connections and provides detailed information about current sessions
        - Existing connections are detected using $Global:DefaultViServers and the function returns without attempting duplicate connections
        - Connection failures are logged with detailed error information and terminate script execution with exit code 1
        - The function integrates with the VCF PowerShell Toolbox logging infrastructure for consistent reporting
        - Both server types use the same underlying VMware PowerCLI Connect-VIServer cmdlet
        - Username information is displayed for existing connections when available from the connection context
        - Connection attempts use SuppressOutputToScreen for initial connection messages to reduce console verbosity

Function Test-VcenterConnection {
    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        Tests if an active and valid vCenter connection exists with minimal overhead.

        .DESCRIPTION
        This function efficiently validates that:
        1. A PowerCLI session exists to the specified vCenter
        2. The session is marked as connected (IsConnected = $true)
        3. The connection is actually alive (can execute a lightweight API call)

        The function uses a two-phase check:
        - Phase 1: Fast check of $Global:DefaultViServers (cached session state)
        - Phase 2: Lightweight API call (Get-Datacenter -Name '*') to verify connectivity

        This provides minimal overhead while ensuring the connection is truly functional
        before attempting more complex operations that would fail with cryptic errors.

        .PARAMETER ServerName
        The hostname or IP address of the vCenter to test connectivity to.
        If not specified, uses $Script:vCenterName.

        .PARAMETER SkipConnectivityTest
        When specified, only checks if a session exists without making an API call.
        This is faster but doesn't verify the connection is still alive (useful if you
        just want to check session existence, not actual connectivity).

        .OUTPUTS
        System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject
        Returns an object with the following properties:
        - IsConnected: Boolean indicating if connection exists and is valid
        - ServerName: The server name that was tested
        - SessionAge: TimeSpan indicating how long the session has been active
        - ErrorMessage: Error message if connection is invalid (null if connected)

        .EXAMPLE
        # Check connection before critical operation (uses $Script:vCenterName by default)
        $connectionTest = Test-VcenterConnection
        if (-not $connectionTest.IsConnected) {
            Write-LogMessage -type ERROR -message "Not connected to vCenter `"$Script:vCenterName`": $($connectionTest.ErrorMessage)"
            exit 1
        }

        .EXAMPLE
        # Fast check without API call
        $sessionExists = Test-VcenterConnection -SkipConnectivityTest
        if ($sessionExists.IsConnected) {
            Write-LogMessage -type DEBUG -suppressOutputToFile -message "Session exists for `"$($sessionExists.ServerName)`" (age: $($sessionExists.SessionAge))"

        if ($result.IsConnected) {
            Write-LogMessage -type INFO -message "Connection to `"$($result.ServerName)`" is valid"
        }

        .NOTES
        Performance Characteristics:
        - Session check only: <1ms (just checks $Global:DefaultViServers)
        - With connectivity test: ~50-100ms (one lightweight API call)
        - Much faster than retrying failed operations

        Error Handling: This is a validation function. Returns structured result object
        with success/failure information. Does not terminate script execution.

        Use Cases:
        - Before long-running operations to fail fast
        - In loops where connection might time out
        - After network-related errors to determine if reconnection needed
        - In finally blocks to check if cleanup is needed

Function Disconnect-Vcenter {

    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        Safely disconnects from vCenter or ESX host instances with support for individual or bulk disconnection.

        .DESCRIPTION
        The Disconnect-Vcenter function provides a safe and reliable way to disconnect from
        vCenter and/or ESX host instances. It includes comprehensive error handling
        to ensure that disconnection failures are properly logged and handled. The function
        supports both individual server disconnection and bulk disconnection from all active
        connections, making it flexible for various cleanup scenarios.

        The function uses forced disconnection with confirmation suppression to ensure
        reliable cleanup in automated scenarios, making it ideal for script cleanup
        operations and error handling routines. After disconnection, it verifies that
        all connections have been properly terminated by checking $Global:DefaultVIServer.

        Key features:
        - Individual or bulk disconnection management for vCenter and ESX hosts
        - Safe disconnection with comprehensive error handling
        - Post-disconnection verification to ensure clean state
        - Forced disconnection to handle active operations gracefully
        - Confirmation suppression for automated execution
        - Integration with VCF PowerShell Toolbox logging infrastructure

        The function is typically called at the end of scripts, in error handling
        scenarios, or when switching between different server connections to ensure
        proper cleanup of VMware PowerCLI connections.

        .PARAMETER AllServers
        Optional switch parameter that disconnects from all active vCenter and ESX host connections.
        When specified, the function uses wildcard disconnection (Disconnect-VIServer -Server *)
        to terminate all active PowerCLI sessions. This is useful for cleanup scenarios where
        all connections should be terminated regardless of which servers are connected.
        Cannot be used together with ServerName parameter.

        .PARAMETER ServerName
        Optional. The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP address of a specific server to disconnect from.
        This can be either a vCenter or an ESX host, depending on the ServerType parameter.
        This should match the server name used in the original connection.
        Required when AllServers is not specified.

        .PARAMETER ServerType
        Optional. Specifies the type of server being disconnected from. Valid values are "vCenter" or "ESX".
        This parameter is used for logging context but is not strictly required for disconnection.
        - "vCenter": Indicates disconnection from a vCenter instance
        - "ESX": Indicates disconnection from an ESX host instance

        .PARAMETER Silence
        Optional switch parameter that suppresses console output for disconnection success messages.
        When specified, successful disconnections are logged with SuppressOutputToScreen flag,
        preventing console output while maintaining log file entries. Error messages are still
        displayed regardless of this parameter. This is useful for automated scenarios where
        verbose console output should be minimized while preserving audit trail functionality.

        .EXAMPLE
        Disconnect-Vcenter -AllServers

        Disconnects from all active vCenter and ESX host connections with verification.
        This is the recommended approach for script cleanup and error handling.

        .EXAMPLE
        Disconnect-Vcenter -AllServers -Silence

        Quietly disconnects from all active connections with suppressed console output.
        Useful for automated cleanup scenarios.

        .EXAMPLE
        Disconnect-Vcenter -ServerName "vcenter.example.com" -ServerType "vCenter"

        Disconnects from a specific vCenter with error handling and logging.

        .EXAMPLE
        Disconnect-Vcenter -ServerName $esxHost -ServerType "ESX" -Silence

        Disconnects from a specific ESX host with suppressed console output for success messages.

        .NOTES
        - Requires VMware PowerCLI to be installed and imported before execution
        - The function uses Force parameter to ensure disconnection even with active operations or tasks
        - Confirmation prompts are suppressed (Confirm:$false) for automated execution in scripts
        - Post-disconnection verification checks $Global:DefaultVIServer to ensure clean state
        - If any connections remain after disconnection attempt, the function exits with code 1
        - The allServers switch is recommended for cleanup scenarios to ensure all connections are terminated
        - Error handling provides detailed logging with ErrorAction:Stop to ensure disconnection failures are caught
        - The function integrates with VCF PowerShell Toolbox logging infrastructure for consistent reporting
        - Proper disconnection prevents resource leaks and ensures clean session management
        - Function is designed for use in cleanup scenarios, error handling routines, and temporary connection management

Function Test-VCenterVersion {

    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        Validates that vCenter is running a specified minimum version or later.

        .DESCRIPTION
        The Test-VCenterVersion function checks the version of the connected vCenter
        to ensure it meets a specified minimum version requirement. This validation is critical
        for ensuring that the vCenter supports the features and APIs required for
        deployment operations.

        The function retrieves the vCenter version from the connected vCenter instance
        (identified by $Script:vCenterName) using the PowerCLI API version information. It
        accepts a minimum required version as a parameter in the format "major.minor.patch"
        (e.g., "9.0.0") and performs a semantic version comparison to validate that the
        detected version meets or exceeds the requirement.

        The minimum version string is parsed within the function to extract major, minor, and
        patch components for comparison against the detected vCenter version.

        Key features:
        - Retrieves vCenter version from active connection using $Script:vCenterName
        - Accepts flexible minimum version parameter (major.minor.patch format)
        - Performs semantic version comparison (major.minor.patch)
        - Provides detailed error messages for version mismatches
        - Logs version information for audit trail
        - Returns standardized result object for error handling

        .PARAMETER MinimumVersion
        The minimum required version in "major.minor.patch" format (e.g., "9.0.0", "8.0.3").
        This parameter is mandatory and determines the version threshold for validation.
        The version string must contain at least three dot-separated numeric components.

        .EXAMPLE
        $result = Test-VCenterVersion -MinimumVersion "9.0.0"
        if (-not $result.Success) {
            Write-Host "Version validation failed: $($result.ErrorMessage)"
            exit 1
        }

        Validates the vCenter version against a minimum requirement of 9.0.0.

        .EXAMPLE
        Test-VCenterVersion -MinimumVersion "8.0.3"

        Validates the vCenter version with a minimum requirement of 8.0.3.

        .OUTPUTS
        PSCustomObject
        Returns an object with the following properties:
        - Success: Boolean indicating whether validation passed
        - ErrorMessage: String containing error details if validation failed (null on success)
        - ErrorCode: String containing error code if validation failed (null on success)
        - Version: String containing the detected vCenter version
        - MinimumVersion: String containing the minimum required version

        .NOTES
        - Requires an active connection to vCenter (via Connect-Vcenter)
        - Uses $Script:vCenterName global variable to identify the connected vCenter
        - The function uses $Global:DefaultViServers to access connection information
        - Version comparison follows semantic versioning rules (major.minor.patch)
        - Returns error result object on failure instead of throwing exceptions
        - Integrates with Write-LogMessage for consistent logging
        - Version strings must be in format "major.minor.patch" (e.g., "9.0.0")

        Error Handling: Validation function. Returns structured error object via Write-ErrorAndReturn
        on any validation failure. Caller should check $result.Success and decide whether to exit
        or continue. Typically, main workflow functions call 'exit 1' on version validation failure.
